{#
 # 404 template
 # ------------
 #
 # This template is loaded whenever Craft cannot figure out how to
 # respond to an incoming request. No setup is involved to get your
 # 404 page working; you just need to call it 404.html and put it
 # at the root of your craft/templates/ folder.
 #
 # You can also create 400.html, 403.html, 500.html, and 503.html
 # templates if you’d like. If Craft can’t find an error template
 # to match the error code, it will just use the one in
 # craft/app/templates/ instead.
 #
 # See this page for more details on how Craft routes requests:
 # http://craftcms.com/docs/routing
 #}

{#
#  Fetch the 404 Single entry, if we don’t already have it.
#  (requests to /404 will already have it.)
#}
